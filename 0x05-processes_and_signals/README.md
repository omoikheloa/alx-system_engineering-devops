This task focuses on understanding the concept of Process IDs (PIDs), managing processes, and signaling in Linux environments. Participants will explore various commands and techniques to interact with processes and utilize signals for process management.

Task Objectives:
Understanding Process IDs (PIDs): Gain familiarity with the concept of PIDs, their significance in process management, and how to identify them.

Process Management: Learn techniques for managing processes, including starting, stopping, pausing, and monitoring.

Signal Handling: Explore signal handling mechanisms in Linux, including sending signals to processes and understanding common signals.

Task Requirements:
Linux Environment: Ensure access to a Linux-based operating system. This could be a local installation or a virtual machine.

Terminal Access: Familiarize yourself with the terminal interface to execute commands and interact with processes.

Task Steps:
Viewing Process IDs (PIDs):

Use the ps command to list running processes along with their PIDs.
Understand the structure and meaning of PID numbers.
Managing Processes:

Start a new process using the & operator to run it in the background.
Use kill command to terminate a process by PID.
Explore killall command to terminate multiple processes by name.
Investigate pgrep and pkill commands for process identification and termination.
Signal Handling:

Learn about common signals such as SIGINT (2), SIGTERM (15), and SIGKILL (9).
Send signals to processes using the kill command.
Experiment with different signals and observe their effects on processes.
Advanced Tasks (Optional):

Explore process priorities and scheduling with nice and renice commands.
Investigate process control and monitoring using tools like top and htop.
Experiment with process communication through signals and shared memory.
Resources:
Linux man pages for commands (man ps, man kill, etc.).
Online tutorials and documentation on Linux process management and signals.
Practice exercises and scenarios to reinforce understanding.
Conclusion:
Mastering process management and signal handling is crucial for efficient system administration and software development on Linux. By completing this task, participants will enhance their proficiency in controlling processes, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing system performance.
