OSI Model:

What it is: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.
How many layers it has: The OSI Model consists of seven layers.
How it is organized: The OSI Model is organized hierarchically, with each layer representing a specific function or set of functions within a network communication process. The layers are designed to facilitate communication between different devices and systems by defining standardized protocols and interfaces.
LAN (Local Area Network):

What it is: A LAN is a network that connects computers and other devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office building, or campus.
Typical usage: LANs are commonly used for sharing resources such as files, printers, and internet connections among connected devices.
Typical geographical size: LANs typically cover a relatively small geographical area, such as a single building or a group of buildings within close proximity.
WAN (Wide Area Network):

What it is: A WAN is a network that connects computers and other devices over a large geographical area, often spanning cities, countries, or continents.
Typical usage: WANs are used to connect LANs and other networks together, enabling communication between geographically dispersed locations.
Typical geographical size: WANs cover large geographical areas, often spanning vast distances between different regions or countries.
Internet:

What it is: The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and other devices that communicate using standardized protocols such as TCP/IP.
IP Address:

What is an IP address: An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
What are the 2 types of IP address: The two types of IP addresses are IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6).
Localhost:

What it is: Localhost refers to the loopback network interface of a device, typically represented by the IP address 127.0.0.1, which allows a device to communicate with itself.
Subnet:

What it is: A subnet is a logically segmented portion of a larger network, identified by a subnet mask, that enables more efficient use of IP addresses and better organization of network resources.
IPv6:

Why IPv6 was created: IPv6 was created to address the limitations of IPv4, such as address exhaustion, by providing a significantly larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the Internet.
TCP/UDP:

What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP: The two main data transfer protocols for IP are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
What is the main difference between TCP and UDP: The main difference between TCP and UDP is that TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error-checking and flow control mechanisms, while UDP provides unreliable, connectionless communication without guaranteed delivery or acknowledgment of packets.
Port:

What is a port: A port is a logical endpoint within a device that is used to uniquely identify a specific application or service running on that device.
SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers:

SSH: Port 22
HTTP: Port 80
HTTPS: Port 443
Network Connectivity Tool/Protocol:

What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network: The Ping tool/protocol is often used to check network connectivity by sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packets to a specific IP address and waiting for an ICMP echo reply.
