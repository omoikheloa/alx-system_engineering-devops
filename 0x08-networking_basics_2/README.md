1. What is localhost?
Localhost refers to the loopback network interface of a device, commonly represented by the IP address 127.0.0.1 in IPv4 or ::1 in IPv6. It allows a device to communicate with itself, enabling testing and accessing services running on the same machine.
2. What is 0.0.0.0?
0.0.0.0 is a special IP address commonly used to represent "all IPv4 addresses" or "any address available on the local machine." It's often used to bind network sockets to all available interfaces on a device.
3. What is the hosts file?
The hosts file is a local text file used by the operating system to map hostnames to IP addresses before querying DNS servers. It allows users to define custom mappings, overriding DNS resolution for specific domains or IP addresses.
4. Netcat (nc) examples:
Netcat (nc) is a versatile networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections. Here are a few examples of its usage:
nc -l -p <port>: Start a netcat server on a specific port.
nc <host> <port>: Connect to a netcat server running on a specified host and port.
nc -v <host> <port>: Connect to a netcat server with verbose output.
nc -u <host> <port>: Use UDP instead of TCP for the connection.
echo "data" | nc <host> <port>: Send data to a netcat server.
nc -l -p <port> > file.txt: Receive data from a netcat client and save it to a file.
5. Man or help:
ifconfig: Displays information about network interfaces.
telnet: A network protocol used for interactive text-based communication.
nc (netcat): A utility for reading from and writing to network connections.
cut: A command-line utility for cutting sections from each line of files.
